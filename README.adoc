== About
This plugin provides some basic sanity checking on html files.

It can be helpful in case of html generated from e.g. {asciidoc-url}[Asciidoctor],
Markdown or other formats - as converters usually don't check for missing images
or broken links.


== Installation

Use the following snippet inside a Gradle build file:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.aim42:htmlSanityCheck-gradle-plugin:{version}'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'htmlSanityCheck'
----

== Usage

The plugin adds a new task named `sanityCheckHtml`.

This task exposes a single property as part of its configuration

[horizontal]
sourceDir:: where the html file is located. Type: File. Default: `build/docs`.
sourceDocumentName:: an override to process a single source file. Type: File.
Defaults to index.html`

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
// append below the line: apply plugin: 'sanityCheckHtml'

sanityCheckHtml {
    outputDir = new File("$buildDir/docs")
}
----

== Types of Sanity Checks

=== Broken Internal Links

Finds all '<a href="XYZ">' where XYZ is not defined.

.src/broken.html
[source,html]
----
<a href="#missing>internal anchor</a>
...
<h2 id="missinG">Bookmark-Header</h2>
----

In this example, the bookmark is _misspelled_.
TODO: If an anchor XYZ is undefined, the plugin will look for _similar_ definitions
(using a sophisticated string-similarity algorithm).

=== Missing Images
Images, referenced in '<img src="XYZ"...' tags, refer to external files. The existence of
these files is checked by the plugin.

=== Multiple Definitions of Bookmarks or ID's
If any is defined more than once, any anchor linking to it will be confused :-)


=== Broken External Links
Although external links might suffer from network issues or site maintenance,
checks are still possible...


== Development
There is a small and largely unpolished
link:docs/DevelopmentGuide.adoc[development guide].

== Fundamentals
This tiny piece rests on incredible groundwork:

* http://jsoup.org[Jsoup HTML parser] and analysis toolkit - robust and easy-to-use.

* IntelliJ IDEA - my (Gernot) best (programming) friend.

* Of course, Groovy, Gradle and JUnit.


== Ideas and Origin

* The plugin heavily relies on code provided by the {gradle-url}[Gradle project].

* Inspiration on code organization, implementation and testing of the plugin
came from the {asciidoctor-gradle-plugin-url}[Asciidoctor-Gradle-Plugin] by .

* Code for string similarity calculation by
  https://github.com/rrice/java-string-similarity[Ralph Rice].

* Initial implementation by {gernotstarke}[Gernot Starke].

== Development
Several sources provided help during development:

* http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/custom_plugins.html[Gradle guide on writing custom plugins]
* The code4reference tutorial an Gradle custom plugins,
http://code4reference.com/2012/08/gradle-custom-plugin-part-1/[part 1] and
http://code4reference.com/2012/08/gradle-custom-plugin-part-2/[part 2].
* Of course, the http://jsoup.org/apidocs/[JSoup API documentation]

== Introduction and Goals

[NOTE]
====
Within the following text, the "Html Sanity Checker" shall be abbreviated with +HtmlSC+
====


=== Requirements Overview

+HtmlSC+ shall provide the following functionality:


. +HtmlSC+ shall read a single (configurable) html file and perform the following checks:
.. Check all image tags wether the referenced image files exist
.. Check all internal links from anchor-tags (href="XYZ") wether the link targets "XYZ"
are defined
.. Check all bookmark definitions (... id="XYZ") wether the id's ("XYZ") are unique.

. +HtmlSC+ can be configured to either
.. output on stdout (the console)
.. creates an html output within a configurable directory

. +HtmlSC+ can be called from the command line with arguments and options
. +HtmlSC+ can be integrated in a gradle-build as plugin.

(gradle-based) build process

== Constraints

* Shall be platform independend and should run on the major operating systems
(Windows (TM), Linux and Mac-OS(TM))
* Shall be integrated with the Gradle build tool
* Liberal open-source license

== Context


== Building Block View

== Runtime View
Note: Not appropriate for this system due to very simple implementation.

== Deployment View
Sanity checker will

1. be bundled as a single jar.
2. be uploaded to a public repository (MavenCentral, JCenter, Bintray or similar),
referencable within a gradle buildfile.
3. provide a +main+ method with parameters and options, so all checks can be
called from the command line.
